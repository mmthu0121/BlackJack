# Black Jack Project using Python

This is the second semester project to understand the intermediate level python.

Initially, the player has 1000 Euros in the hand and he/she can select the amount of games he/she wants to play. The player can also choose if he/she wants to play him/herself or simulate the game.

When the game starts, the deck will be shuffle and each player will receive two cards. The game will go on as the original Blackjack but unlike the real world game, the card will not be shuffled again until all 52 cards are used.

As data processing part of the program, the program will display the dealer's first cards and the amount of player's win with bar chart.
